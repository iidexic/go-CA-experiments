/*SECTION - HOW INPUT HANDLING/KB ASSIGN/FUNCTION TRIGGER GOING WORK
var KEYMAPassignments []func() = []func(){} //this aint happening atm
- this is like first thing I can think of, actually havent thought of it yet
- whatever comes out comes out
- will need to write settings to a file at some point

STRUCTURE
-----------------
We are getting ints, we can grab the actual key they are assigned to pretty easily
- Gonna assume can probably go key str -> int easily as well, will figure out later if comes into play

easiest is to put a bunch of functions in a slice and use the keyboard key as slice
> Question from here: Will there not be variable Param/Return requirements?

For now I am just going to hardcode functions as they come up.
Later I can look at big picture to see if theres a better way
